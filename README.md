# Getting Started

Facetcher is an app designed to generating images of human face based on hand drawing sketches. The app has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to create facial sketches and generate images of suspects.
To use the app, users first provide basic case details such as the title, gender, and description. They can then begin drawing the facial sketch using the app's intuitive drawing tools. Once the sketch is complete, the app generates an image of the suspect based on the sketch.
Users can edit the sketch until they are happy with the result. Once the user is satisfied with the generated image, they can submit the sketch along with case details and the generated image to the app.
The app also provides a history screen that displays all the cases submitted by the user, allowing them to easily access past sketches and results. Users can export the generated image as a PDF file for convenient saving and sharing..
